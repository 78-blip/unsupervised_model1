# UNSUPERVISED MODEL-CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION WITH THE HELP OF K-MEANS CLUSTERING AND HIERARCHIAL CLUSTERING
# DATA
'InvoiceNo'-it gives us the invoice number for every unique transaction.

'stockCode'-it gives the code number for the type of product.

'Description'-it describes more about product in textual language.

'Quantity'-it shows us the quantity of particular product purchased

'InvoiceDate'-it shows date on which transaction was done

'UnitPrice'-it gives the price per unit of particular prodduct.

'CustomerID'-it is given to uniquely identify every customer

'Country'-it gives us the name of country to which every customer belongs

# SUMMARY
Here i am given a dataset related to online retail customer segmentation in which i have to form the clusters of same kind of customers by applying my algorithms and prepare a good model which does this well ,my columns in he dataset are:InvoiceNo', 'StockCode', 'Description', 'Quantity', 'InvoiceDate', 'UnitPrice', 'CustomerID', 'Country' etc, what i will be doing in the dataset is: cleaning my data ,makimg analysis omn columns finding correlation.

after that i will be creating clusters on the basis of proximity in variables value.

Here by ,i will bw working on the data set related to wholesale purchase and its analysis in various variables upon which ,a useful conclusion will be drawn ‚Åâ

:using graphs and charts ,useful indights will be made

:the base of my project will be to use the acquired knowledge of dataset and fetch workings and swot analysis , and make plans for same.

: the project is to direct my efforts to make a gist of important parameters.

:i will bw adjusting the data to need

:data will be trandformed into structured information to use,

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this project, your task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. Data Description

# BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
my business objective here is:

My business objective is to draw useful insights from the given dataset in order to make better decisions,these will include the following steps which are to take place throughout my project:

:to draw useful charts and graphs which will itself show and visualise the important variable.

:to filter useful data and make resuklt out of it

:to make plans and policies out of data and working on it further.

; to make my algorithm work on the dara and make customer segmentation

# LIBRARIES USED
NUMPY: NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.

PANDAS: Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

MATPLOTLIB Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible. Create publication quality plots. Make interactive figures that can zoom, pan, update.

SEABORN Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data

# ALGORITHMS USED:
K-MEANS CLUSTERING
k-means cluster analysis is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint of cluster analysis is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.

HIERARCHIAL CLUSTERING
Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.
