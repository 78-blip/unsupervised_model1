In order to achieve the business objective,i would suggest the client:

1.on the basis of k means clustering:

.That as our customers are segmented into two clusters on the basis of clvt value: :we should keep more focus on high lifetime expected customers as they would contribute more to the growth .

:we should try to manipulate and give reasons to low lifetime expected customers so as to retain them .

:we should strike a balance between both the clusters

:more and more betternment of services should be done for high value customers

2.on the basis of hierarchial clustering

.our customers are segmented into two clusters in hierarchial clustering also :we should keep more focus on high spending customers

:we should prioritise hi9gh value customers
