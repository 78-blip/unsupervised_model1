From the above project,my conclusions are as follows:

:on the basis of customer expected lifetime value,we have 2 clusters,whereby we should focus on and in:

.high expected lifetime value as these customers are gtoing to contribute more to the growth and solvency of business.

: we can seee that blue scattered points are less in number ,so we shoul fovcus more on few customers of high value

:on the basis of money spent we have 2 clusters in which also:

.we should focus on high spending customers

there are only few customers in class 0 and many customers in class1
