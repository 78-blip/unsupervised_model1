# DATA MANIPULATION
DATA FILTERATION
I have filtered the data ‚Åâ

i have created a new unique id as a new variable to store every booking uniquely in order to fecilitate counting,,from the dataset so as to make it more informative.

,i have filtered important variables on which i will be working 

HANDLING OUTLIERS:
THE TECHNIQUE I USED FOR REMOVING OUTLIERS INVOLVES FOLLOWING STEPS:

FIRST WE HAVE ALREADY MADE BOXPLOT AND HISTOGRAM IN CHARTS FROM WHERE WE GET TO KNOW ALL COMMON RANGE AND OUTLIERS

NOW WE HAVE MADE NEW DATASET TO INCLUDE ALL VARIABLES BY USING FLITERS

THIS TECHNIQUE IS SOMEHOW SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE.

HANDLING MISSING VALUES
 here i have removed the columns containing more than 60% null values.
we have also used substitituting null values criteria
